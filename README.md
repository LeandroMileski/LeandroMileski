## Full-Stack Developer & Cloud Solutions Enthusiast

Iâ€™m a versatile developer with a passion for building scalable, efficient solutions. With extensive experience in back-end development (Java, Spring Boot, Node.js), cloud architecture (AWS), and front-end technologies (React, Next.js), I thrive on creating impactful projects, from MVPs to optimized production systems.
